The present research is about monaural speech enhancement. The purpose of speech enhancement is to remove background noise and reverberation from recorded speech. Here, two state-of-the-art models are introduced for this purpose, one in the time domain (Denoiser model) and the other in the time-frequency domain (FullSubNet model).
1. You can download and generate data from here: https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge
2. You can yourself train the model or apply one of the pre-trained models of FullSubNet from here: https://fullsubnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
3. You can yourself train the model or apply one of the pre-trained models of Denoiser from here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/denoise
The folder "models" was adapted from the above repositories.
